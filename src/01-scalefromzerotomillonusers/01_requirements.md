# Scale from Zero to Million Users - Requirements

## Functional Requirements

1. **User Management**: Users can register, login, and manage their accounts
2. **Core Features**: System provides core functionality (varies by application type)
3. **Data Persistence**: All user data and application data must be stored reliably
4. **API Access**: System provides APIs for client applications

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- **Response Time**: API responses should be <200ms for p95 latency
- **Throughput**: System must handle increasing load as user base grows
- **Availability**: System should maintain high availability (99.9%+ uptime)

### Scalability

- **Horizontal Scaling**: System must be able to scale horizontally
- **Vertical Scaling**: Initial phases may use vertical scaling
- **Elasticity**: System should handle traffic spikes gracefully

### Cost Efficiency

- **Start Small**: Initial infrastructure should be cost-effective for small user base
- **Optimize Costs**: Cost per user should decrease as scale increases
- **Resource Utilization**: Efficient use of compute and storage resources

## Scale Considerations

### Phase 1: 0-1,000 Users

- **Traffic**: ~100 requests/second
- **Storage**: <10 GB
- **Infrastructure**: Single server sufficient

### Phase 2: 1,000-100,000 Users

- **Traffic**: ~1,000 requests/second
- **Storage**: <1 TB
- **Infrastructure**: Vertical scaling, read replicas

### Phase 3: 100,000-1,000,000 Users

- **Traffic**: ~10,000 requests/second
- **Storage**: <10 TB
- **Infrastructure**: Horizontal scaling, caching, load balancing

### Phase 4: 1,000,000+ Users

- **Traffic**: ~100,000+ requests/second
- **Storage**: 100+ TB
- **Infrastructure**: Distributed systems, microservices, global distribution

## Constraints

- **Budget**: Limited budget in early phases
- **Team Size**: Small team initially, grows with scale
- **Time to Market**: Need to launch quickly, optimize later
- **Technical Debt**: Acceptable in early phases, must be addressed before scaling
