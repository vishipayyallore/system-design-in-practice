# Scale from Zero to Million Users Case Study

A comprehensive system design case study for scaling a system from zero to millions of users.

## Overview

This case study covers the complete design journey of scaling a system from initial launch to handling millions of users, including capacity planning, infrastructure evolution, and scaling strategies.

## Key Design Highlights

### Scaling Journey

- **Phase 1 (0-1K users)**: Single server, monolithic architecture
- **Phase 2 (1K-100K users)**: Vertical scaling, database optimization
- **Phase 3 (100K-1M users)**: Horizontal scaling, caching, load balancing
- **Phase 4 (1M+ users)**: Microservices, distributed systems, global distribution

### Technology Evolution

- **Initial**: Single server, SQLite/MySQL, simple deployment
- **Growth**: Load balancer, Redis cache, read replicas
- **Scale**: Microservices, NoSQL databases, message queues, CDN

## Learning Objectives

After studying this case study, you should be able to:

- Plan capacity and infrastructure for different user scales
- Design systems that can evolve from simple to complex
- Choose appropriate technologies for each growth phase
- Implement scaling strategies (vertical and horizontal)
- Design for performance and cost optimization
- Plan infrastructure evolution and migration paths
